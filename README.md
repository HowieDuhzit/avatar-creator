This repo contains:

* [`packages/avatar-creator`](packages/avatar-creator) â€“ a React component library that lets users build fully-rigged 3D avatars powered by the [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com) engine.
* [`examples/avatar-preview-app`](examples/avatar-preview-app) â€“ a minimal Next.js application that embeds the Avatar Creator and serves as a live playground / reference integration.

## TODO:
* [ ] Make UI more composable as part of a wider application (e.g. not assuming fullscreen)
* [ ] Add API for loading and saving avatar configurations
* [ ] Update data model to allow more flexibility for custom part combinations
* [ ] Publish the avatar-creator library to npm

1. **Install dependencies (workspace-wide)**

   ```bash
   nvm use # otherwise use Node.js v22.x
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development servers**

   ```bash
   npm run iterate # or `npm run dev`
   ```

   This will:
   * build `packages/avatar-creator` in watch-mode
   * launch the Next.js preview app on <http://localhost:3000>

   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser â€“ you should see the Avatar Creator embedded in the preview site.

> ðŸ’¡  Prefer to run packages individually?
>
> ```bash
> # in one terminal â€“ build the library and serve static assets
> cd packages/avatar-creator && npm run iterate
>
> # in another terminal â€“ start the preview app
> cd examples/avatar-preview-app && npm run iterate
> ```

---

## Production Builds

```bash
# build everything
npm run build

# preview the Next.js production build
cd examples/avatar-preview-app && npm run start
```

The library is compiled to ESM bundles (and type declarations) under `packages/avatar-creator/build/`.
